# OpenGL Course Reflection
How do I approach designing software?
--
I approach designing software by reviewing my available tools, reading any prewritten code and comments, and setting up TODO sections that modularize programs into separate functions. Being given partially written programs for schoolwork feels similar to workplace scenarios in which I'll be working with a team on a single program. As such, it's excellent practice to familiarize myself with parts of the code I didn't write before editing any TODO sections. This simple act often clears up questions before they arise, although larger programs would require skimming or searching, instead.

Reviewing the pre-existing code was the key to success for this OpenGL project. Learning how to create, transform, texture, and light shapes came from examining what features already existed in the provided code. This taught me what function calls to use (and how to use them) when summoning my own shapes from the low-level code.

How do I approach developing programs?

I approach developing programs by implementing solutions that match my skillset. With the Internet at my fingertips for finding answers to complex problems, I don't think it does me any favors to use code from a Stack Overflow post that I don't understand, for example. Instead, I look to my notes, course readings, and relevant documentation to see if I can find a clever solution with the tools I already have. If not, then I search around for pre-built libraries that may be just what I'm looking for. Either way, the approach follows the same path of problem solving, which results in greater skill gain.
